							<p>Working in a team of 8, we had to produce a game over the span of 12 weeks. The theme of the game is natural elements, such as water. 
							I was responsible for the creation of the fire-themed level, and I was responsible for the creation of many gameplay elements such as traps
							and moving components such as air columns and moving platforms, as well as animating the aforementioned traps. 

							In the level you will see that when a player steps onto a platform, it will raise them up, and as soon as they stop standing on the platform, the
							platform stops moving. This presented many challenges, one of them was with the way in which the platform moved. At first the platform would be 
							translated up incrementally according to deltaTime, but this would lead to a situation where if the player tried jumping back onto the platform,
							they would clip through it as the platform gets translated through the player. To rectify it, I changed the platform to use unity's addforce
							function, as this actually makes the platform actually have a force that affects the world, and thus does not result in a situation where the
							teleports through the player. I also was responsible for the creation of some of the game's assets, such as the volcano at the end of the level, 
							which was made in blender. I also had to texture the assets and make the level look like a volcanic eruption.
							</p>

							<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work as a team, and better understand the value that source control tools such as github and perforce, can 
							bring to the workflow of a project.
