							<p>I took part in the Interactive Real-Time 3D Skills Bootcamp with INFINITY27 on the development course. This involved me working on an 
								existing game project known as Samsara, which is a dark souls style game with a Buddhist reincarnation theme. During my time I 
								gained experience with many games industry standard tools such as Unreal Engine 5 and blueprints,source control via Perforce,
								remote working via Parsec to access work laptops, and project management via Hansoft to define the scope of the project. As well 
								as this I have become more familiar with the developmental process of games companies, and how they use techniques such as AGILE 
								and SCRUM to perform iterative changes to their projects. As you can see below I have had the pleasure of creating my own spell 
								within the game, which I have named 'Winds of Fortune'. This is an ability that summons the power of the Tibetan Wind horse to push 
								back enemies and stuns them for a brief amount of time. It also grants the Player extra max HP and damage if they hit an enemy with 
								the spell. The purpose of this is so that the player can escape a bad situation if they are surrounded by enemies. Through designing
								this spell, I have learned much more about how to implement functionality through visual scripting, and how that interfaces with the
								 game engine to create a completed product.
