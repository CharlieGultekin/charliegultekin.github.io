							<p>Working in a team of 8, we had to produce a game over the span of 12 weeks. The theme of the game is natural elements, such as water. 
							I was responsible for the creation of the fire-themed level, and I was responsible for the creation of many gameplay elements such as traps
							and moving components such as air columns and moving platforms, as well as animating the aforementioned traps. 

							In the level you will see that when a player steps onto a platform, it will raise them up, and as soon as they stop standing on the platform, the
							platform stops moving. This presented many challenges, one of them was with the way in which the platform moved. At first the platform would be 
							translated up incrementally according to deltaTime, but this would lead to a situation where if the player tried jumping back onto the platform,
							they would clip through it as the platform gets translated through the player. To rectify it, I changed the platform to use unity's addforce
							function, as this actually makes the platform actually have a force that affects the world, and thus does not result in a situation where the
							teleports through the player. I also was responsible for the creation of some of the game's assets, such as the volcano at the end of the level, 
							which was made in blender. I also had to texture the assets and make the level look like a volcanic eruption is occuring.
							</p>

							<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work as a team, and as a result of this module, I acquired a better understanding of the value that 
								source control tools such as github and perforce, can bring to the workflow of a project. If i was to improve on my contribution, I would 
								have made the level longer, and allowed the player to travel inside the volcano rather than have it as a background element. This was attempted
								with a script that allowed the player to keep moving forward but within a circle since I originally wanted the level to end at the top of the 
								volcano, but due to time constraints that was scrapped. I also could have put some enemies into the level to shoot, however when playtesting, 
								I thought the level would be too hard since the level itself is much harder to navigate safely than the other levels, and the majority of 
								player deaths were a result of falling into the lava below.

							<h1 class="major"> Artifical intelligence</h1>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lqj2WUvOx14?si=Ll0sP2hc7l6WX5AV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p> Here is a clip of the work I did towards one of my 2nd Year University modules, Artificial intelligence for games. This is a demonstration of 
								steering behaviours, which are individual states that an AI can be in, for example 'Wander', which is a state that makes the AI roam in a random 
								direction. Another example is 'Pursue', where an AI follows a specific target, like a player or another AI. This is demonstrated in the video provided. 
								The red car is programmed to follow the blue car, and the blue car is programmed to go to random "blue" waypoints on the map. The cars are also 
								capable of running out of fuel after around 100 seconds, and will go slowly as you'll see. They therefore must pick up fuel pick ups as they go. 
								They can also pick up passengers, and can grab the speed boost powerup to boost their speed.

								If I was to improve upon this project in the future, I would look into implementation of pathfinding techniques such as Dijkstra and A*, 
								so that the cars move more convincingly through the given scenario, instead of travelling through the buildings. This would require me
								to take into account the red waypoints on the map that mark the corners of the buildings, and not letting the AI travel through the perimeter between 
								these points.
